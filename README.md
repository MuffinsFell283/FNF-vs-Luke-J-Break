# Friday Night Funkin' vs Luke=J=Break Midsummer Harbor

## Story
 When the BFs arrive at the harbor, they meet Luke, a young man traveling the ocean on a white yacht in the hot sun, and set up a rap battle with him...

## Q&A
 ### Who is he?
  He is a young man who travels the world, crossing the seas with his characteristic hammer and white yacht.

  This time I happened to meet BF at a port and we had a rap battle.

 ### How old is he?
  He is 18 years old. The hammer was given to him by his father when he was 12.

 ### Why is he traveling?
  Because it was his father's will. His father left a message that he wanted him to see many different worlds and have a broader perspective.

  His father died when he was 14 years old, and at the same time he jumped on a yacht with a hammer that was a memento of his father's death and began his journey.

 ### What can the hammer he has do?
  It can freeze objects struck with this hammer, but it can also be used as a regular hammer.

  He is human, but his father could use magic.

  This hammer was created using that.
 
 ### What is the relationship between Kyle and the other characters from the previous mod?
  We are not thinking about it at this time. It could become completely irrelevant.
